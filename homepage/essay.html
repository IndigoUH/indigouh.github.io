          <h1> My New York Essay </h1>
          <p>
            I remember when I was six years old and me and my family took a trip to Brooklyn Bridge Park. It was a beautiful summer morning and we decided to go to the playground in Pier 6. I was excited because the playground had these really fun swings that were hoisted over a bright blue plastic terrain. We had gone to these swings before and I remember having the time of my life on them. We got there and had a great time out. When me and my sister were finished playing, our parents decided that we would take a walk around the pier. This was my first time exploring this massive Pier 6 park that seemed ginormous to a little kid. After we finished looking around Pier 6 we decided to walk around and see the other piers. That was when I saw the brilliantly gargantuan field that my dad told me was Pier 5. This was unlike anything I had ever seen before and it fascinated me. Every trip to Brooklyn Bridge Park until I was old enough to know how to play soccer was filled with curiosity and amazement at the Pier 5 field.

            The first time going on the field was a grand experience. There was nothing like the feeling of the spongy and flexible turf, the strong ground underneath, and the brilliant orange light being cast onto the field. The experience of taking the ball out of our bag, kicking it around on a late Saturday afternoon, and picking up a sweat but feeling a cool river breeze coming in made me feel comfortable and at peace. There was a constant feeling of a dry throat and sore limbs but the accomplishment and joy when leaving the field made it all worth it. But what stood out to me the most was a view of the city skyline that seemed so much larger than the pier I was standing on. Looking at this skyline one day may be completely different than looking at it another day because of the feeling that it is moving and changing every second that you glance at it. After the ten years I have been going to Pier 5 it feels like the view of the skyline is completely different from what it was when the pier was built. Everything around this place is constantly changing so quickly that you may not even realize when something new pops up or differs.

            But one thing I have noticed is that Pier 5 itself never changes. For ten years it has been the same field, walkway, benches, goals, and nets. Going to Pier 5 now will look the exact same as it did when it was created. The ability to stay the same is partly because of the attention that went into building the field. If you go to any sports field in New York you will see that it is either completely empty or jam packed full for a game. These fieldsâ€™ only purpose is to accommodate sports which seems pointless because why take out a huge piece of land for something that only a few people use each day? They seem like a waste of space that many times get ignored because of how few people visit them. This leads to lower quality fields that decay over time with trash and rotting fences. Pier 5 is the complete opposite of these places. This is a field that was built with thought and care for the people of New York. Its odd location provides for a massive area that can be used for things besides sports. There is a walkway around the pier that lets you get an even better view of the fantastic skyline in front of you. The care and attention when building the pier makes it an extremely popular place for people to visit. Because of the amount of people that go here, it is taken care of and is always clean and respected. This creates a sort of ecosystem on the field which makes it a safe space. Everyone at Pier 5 is usually very welcoming and friendly. Whether that be veterans who know the ins and outs of the sports they play, experienced players that are constantly training and practicing to be the best, new players who want to learn their sport, or friends who just want to have fun. There are people doing their homework, parents watching their kids play, runners taking laps around the field, people fishing over the edge of the pier, or people just sitting down and enjoying the view. There have been countless times where I go to the field by myself expecting to stay for a little while and ending up playing pick up games with strangers for hours. The people here are some of the friendliest and driven people in New York. Along with the city around the field, the people are changing as well. Everyone is constantly growing, training, and learning which creates an environment that pushes you forward and makes you grow as a person. Pier 5 is an amazing place to be and encapsulates everything good about New York.
